# User Guide

The User Guide is intended for audiences that wish to use the Titanis tool suite without getting into the source code.

Each Titanis release includes a set of tools as binaries built for both Windows and Linux.  To get started, download this archive and extract the contents to your local file system.  Note that on Linux, the `x` bit is not set, so you'll need to use `chmod +x` on the executable for each tool before you are able to run it.  The tool executable bears the name of the directory containing it.

* [Common Command Line Syntax](syntax.md) - Overview of the command line syntax and how it is parsed
    * [Authentication Parameters](syntax-auth.md) - Describes how to control authentication with parameters
    * [Handling Tool Output](output.md) - Describes parameters that control the output of the tool
* [Tools Index](tools/index.md) - Lists the tools by name and by task
